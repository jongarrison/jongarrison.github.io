    content: |-
      I am a software engineer currently seeking projects. I have a fair amount of experience applying software to solve problems across a variety of domains. Need to develop an overheat warning system for a large boat engine? I can help. Want to build a machine that verifies a manufactured product is doing what it should? I can help. Do you want to tie your website directly to a back end manufacturing processes? I can help. The potential for software to make things more efficient, more functional, and more delightful is nearly limitless.
