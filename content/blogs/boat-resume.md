Hi Chris and others,

Thanks for the great tour of the Shipwrights' shop on 8/26! If you are willing to consider part-time or per project work, I would really like to be considered for part of the team.

Chris asked that I put together a list of projects and skills that might be relevant to work at Shipwrights. Elsewhere on this site, you'll already find more conventional information about me, like my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathangarrison/) and other more standard projects from me. Here I'll list things more relevant to my experience around boats, making things and adventures that often required learning new skills and building things.

* History with sailing - I grew up in NE Connecticut. For a large chunk of my childhood, my father had a 38' Shannon ketch that he kept in Narragansett Bay. I got a good foundation in coastal cruising from Long Island Sound up to Bar Harbor, Maine. I was in the University of Connecticut Sailing Club which was a pretty casual sailing club. We mostly lake sailed Lasers, but did do some racing on larger boats in Long Island Sound. Years later, a close friend of mine bought a 30' Rawson ketch in Portland, Oregon and I was fortunate to join him for a lot of adventures on the Columbia, San Francisco Bay and then a lot in the San Juan Islands. He and his wife eventually settled in Port Townsend and that was my intro to PT.

* [Nike Innovation (2018-2024)](https://innovation.nike.com/) - Nike Innovation is an amazing R&D department for Nike shoes. I was very lucky to work with a large team of very skilled mechanical engineers primarily as the "software guy", but I did everything from physical prototype builds, electronics prototyping, manufacturing testing machine designing/building and I even made some shoes. I jumped in on many projects dealing with tech that was unfamiliar to me, the team focused on cushioning systems (mostly air bags), but the range of projects we would dream up were all over the place. We worked on wearable electronics (including the electronics for [this project](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240292928A1/en?q=(US)&inventor=levi+patton&assignee=nike)). I got a solid foundation in 3D design (Fusion 360, Rhino3d, and Grasshopper mostly). I used those 3D design skills to build prototypes using a variety of fabrication processes: 3D SLS printing, 3D FDM printing, 3D resin printing, laser cutting, Zund fabric cutting, industrial sewing machines, heat fusing of laminated materials and lots of conventional building. A project that probably touched on the most technologies relevant Shipwrights' would be a manufacturing testing machine that I fully designed and built. Users interacted with a touchscreen RaspberryPi to initiate a number of testing sequences that involved pressure sensing, air flow sensing, motor control and solenoid/pneumatic control.

* [PID Ball Roller Project](https://photos.app.goo.gl/arvyQxHxVxNx8ENEA) - I had encountered custom PID controllers first while doing glass blowing in the early 2000's. The engineer that ran the Firehouse shop had created custom kilns using PID control to maintain temperature. That got the idea in my mind and later when a project came up at Nike Innovation that might need a PID controller, I decided to create a small project to learn the required skills. I created a roller balancing beam. Control was managed by an Arduino controller using a sonar distance sensor and a servo motor. I designed the mechanical parts in OpenSCAD and printed the 3D parts on a kit built Prusa MK3S printer. I used an open source PID code library and an open source PID tuning library as the foundation for the software. It was very fun building and getting the rail balancer to smoothly keep the roller at a target distance from the distance sensor. 

* Fishing Boat Engine Temp Warning System - I helped an Alaskan Fisherman create a cylinder temperature monitoring system for his boats large old Caterpillar diesel engine. He found the hardware and implemented the PLC based software so that he had a touch screen temp viewing and alarm configuration screens in both the engine room and wheelhouse. I learned about PLC programming and networking. I also programmed the GUI interface for configuring alarm states and viewing the temperatures. The ship's alarm was activated by relay when trigger situations arose and the alarm could be cleared from either screen.

* [Yome/Yurt Home Construction](https://www.flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157698405471500/) - I lived on my land in Port Townsend for a few years in a yurt like structure that I built. I purchased the Yome skin used and had to fabricate and then assemble the structure. It was a great place to live! Take a look at the pics to get a sense of the platform and internal structure.

* [Skin on frame boat construction](https://flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157671912177895/) - The same friend that introduced me to PT, got into designing a variety of brilliant skin on frame boats. He did it mostly for fun, but did start a website for sharing the plans, [Hermit Cove Boats](https://www.hermitcoveboats.com/owl). I built a number of rowboats with him. He had an idea for a camping rowboat, he called the Loon and we each built one. One of the adventures involved rowing those two boats from PT for two weeks up into the Canadian Gulf islands (see link below). 

* [Rudder Position Sensor Project](https://jongarrison.github.io/blogs/rudder-sensor/) - See the article about the recent project to translate linear rudder cable motion into rotational motion for a Raymarine rudder position sensor.

* Home renovation - During the years I lived in Portland, I renovated a house and both units of a duplex. I figured it out as I went and did cabinet installation, tiling, hardwood floor installation, replacment of plumbing fixtures and lighting/electrical work.

* Education - I have a dual degree in Engineering and Business Management from the University of Connecticut. It was a long time ago, but both the engineering and management skills have set me up for a wide range of work throughout my career. Here is some history on the [UConn MEM program](https://mem.uconn.edu/about-mem/).

## Adventures! 

I have had a lot of fun getting around in different ways including boats, bicycles, motorcycles and hitchhiking. Boat and Bicycle trips often have involved a lot of fixing and innovating on the way...


[2017 Salish Sea Sailing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157680841154804/) - My wife and I sailed her Tanzer 7.5 from PT up through the San Juans, Gulf Islands and up into the Discovery Islands. In preparation for the trip, we replaced the electrical fuse box, made an riding sail for use at anchor and got good at servicing the Yamaha outboard. The trip involved some fun navigation, with extreme tides and currents up in the Discovery Islands. We got good at anchoring against rock walls.

[2024 Portland to Astoria Rowing Trip](https://www.flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72177720320205020/) - We rolled Red Zep (10 years old at the time) down to the Willamette River in downtown Portland and then rowed a 130 miles or so down to the mouth of the Columbia over 7 days. The boat held up well and so most of the challenges came in the lower Columbia with tidal conditions and labyrinthine sand islands.

[2014 Inside Passage Crewing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157644544117620/with/14132317169) - Sailed on a friend's wooden gaff rigged ketch with a great crew from Port Townsend to Ketchikan, AK. You might recognize a couple of the people from Shipwrights Co-op.

[2014 West Coast Bicycle Trip](https://flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157707820344824/with/15895407960) - My wife and rode two old bikes from Vancouver, BC to San Diego, CA. It was so much fun and we of course did a tremendous amount of bike repair along the way. Notable repairs included the spectacular structure failure of Steph's rear rack mount, which I was able to repair with found items on the side of the road (metal strap and thick copper wire). I also constructed a [guitar carrying rack from a milk crate](https://flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/16133280637/in/album-72157707820344824) found on the road.
